## [0.1.0a1] - 2026-04-27

Initial alpha release. Reserves the `bug-fab` name on PyPI and validates
the publish workflow end-to-end before the `v0.1.0` final release.

`pip install bug-fab` skips alphas by default; install with
`pip install --pre bug-fab` to try this version.

### Added

- Project scaffolding: `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621, Hatchling backend),
  ruff lint and format configuration, pytest configuration with
  coverage gating at 85%.
- Optional dependency extras: `bug-fab[sqlite]` and `bug-fab[postgres]`
  for SQL storage backends via SQLAlchemy and Alembic.
- Pytest plugin entry-point `bug-fab-conformance` reserved for the
  protocol conformance suite consumed by adapter authors.
- Pre-commit configuration with forbidden-strings, ruff, and standard
  hygiene hooks.
- Editor and git metadata: `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes` enforcing
  LF line endings and treating vendored JS as binary.
- GitHub Actions CI: matrix testing on Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12,
  ruff lint and format checks, coverage gate, wheel and sdist build
  with `twine check`, Trusted Publishing to PyPI on `v*` tags.

### Notes

- This release exists primarily to claim the `bug-fab` PyPI name and
  exercise the build/publish pipeline. The package surface itself is
  intentionally minimal; the full v0.1 feature set lands in `0.1.0`.
- Wire-protocol contract is not yet locked. Do not build production
  integrations against this alpha.
